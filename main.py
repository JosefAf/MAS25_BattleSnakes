"""This function retrieves game_state, a dictionary containing all game data, 3 dicts and an int. Here's what it contains:

* game_state["turn"] returns an int, the current turn number of the game (like the current tick number)

* game_state["you"] returns the dictionary of data for our snake (a Battlesnake object), like coordinates of each piece              of the body, its length etc... 
see the details in the docs: https://docs.battlesnake.com/api/objects/battlesnake

* game_state["board"] returns the dictionary of data regarding the game board (a Board object), like the height and width of         the board, the coordinates of food, and the Battlesnake-objects of all snakes in the game etc... 
see the details in the docs: https://docs.battlesnake.com/api/objects/board

* game_state["game"] returns the dictionary of data regarding the game (a Game object), like the id of the game, the ruleset of the game (also a dict, it contains a dict "settings" about more specific set rules for this game), and the timeout time for the game (accessed as game_state["game"][timeout]) etc...
